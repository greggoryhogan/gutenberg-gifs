Search and embed gifs from Tenor to Gutenberg enabled posts, pages and widgets

== Description ==

Gif Search and Embed creates a custom Gutenberg "Gif Search" block that can be used to search and embed gifs available through Tenor. Gifs are treated similar to traditional images that can be captioned, aligned and resized.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I remove the "Via Tenor" attribution below the gif? =

Sorry, no. Tenor's terms and conditions require an attribution below all gifs.

= I don't have a Tenor API key, can I still use this plugin? =

We require each install to acquire their own API key from Tenor. API keys are free and can be created at [https://tenor.com/developer/keyregistration](https://tenor.com/developer/keyregistration)
